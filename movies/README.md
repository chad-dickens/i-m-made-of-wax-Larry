# movies

In this project, I scraped movie data from the IMDb and Metacritic websites, and then analysed it using Pandas and Matplotlib. The scripts I used for scraping are the two Python files, the Jupyter Notebook contains my analysis, and the sqlite database is the output of my scripts.

For best rendering, please view the Jupyter Notebook using nbviewer:
