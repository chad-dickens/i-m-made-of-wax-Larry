# rugby

In this project, I scraped data on professional rugby players in Australia and compared the codes of union and league. The two Python files contain the scripts I used to collect my data, the sqlite database is the output of my scripts, and the jupyter notebook is my analysis.

For best rendering, please view the notebook at the following link:
